# ios_elective_handin
On the course IOS we hand in an assignment each week, which reflects what we've been working on.

Week 17 - Sensors
---
This week we worked with the different sensors in our devices. I made an app which uses CoreMotion to zoom in or out on the map and motionEnded for handling a shake gesture to center the view on the users current location

---
Week 16 - Written assignment
---
No code this week, we handed in a document where we each had to describe closures and the difference between weak and strong variables.

Week 14 - Firebase authentication with facebook login and graph request
---
This week we made a simple app which should display something which couldn't be seen prior to signing in. We used the functionality from firebase authentication to manage users. Then we had to expand the app to be able to log in via facebook. Later we had to use the facebook graph to access user data

Week 13 - Camera Roll
---
An app which can capture pictures and videos from the camera or photo library. It can resize the picture, and add text on top of it. I also added a swipe gesture recognizer so if you swipe right, the photo is saved, and if you swipe left it will dissappear

---

Week 12 - MapView
---
An app with a map where you can long press on the map to set a pin and save the location in firebase. It also shows the userlocation after having requested permission to use location services on the device

We had to make a tableview with two custom cells. One should contain a label and an imageview, and the other should only contain a label

An app with one viewcontroller containing a textview, a tableview and some buttons. The app can save the input from the textview on the phone, and you can then see them in the textview. You can then add and delete notes with the buttons
